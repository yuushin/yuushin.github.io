### Build Issues?

If you get dependency errors (especially about `@radix-ui` packages), run:

```bash
npm run install-clean  # Clean reinstall of all dependencies
npm run build
```

For other build issues, try:
```bash
npm run build-verify  # Complete build verification with cleanup
```

Or see [BUILD_TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./BUILD_TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for detailed debugging steps.
