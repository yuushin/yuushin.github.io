# Final Build Fix Instructions

## Summary of Changes Made

1. **Name Change**: Updated "Alex Chen" to "Ian Betts" in Header and ContactSection components
2. **Email Update**: Changed email from "alex@alexchen.design" to "ian@ianbetts.design"
3. **Dependencies**: Added all required Radix UI dependencies for shadcn/ui components
4. **Public Directory**: Fixed the _redirects file structure

## Critical Issue: Public Directory Structure

**The main build issue is the incorrect _redirects structure.** Your public directory currently has:

```
/public/_redirects/
├── Code-component-44-215.tsx
├── Code-component-44-191.tsx
└── (other .tsx files)
```

**This needs to be a single file:** `/public/_redirects`

## Complete Fix Steps

### Step 1: Fix Public Directory Structure

1. **Delete the entire _redirects directory:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf public/_redirects/
   ```

2. **Create the correct _redirects file:**
   ```bash
   echo "/*    /index.html   200" > public/_redirects
   ```

### Step 2: Install All Dependencies

```bash
npm run install-clean
```

This will reinstall all dependencies including the new Radix UI packages.

### Step 3: Verify Build

```bash
npm run build-verify
```

This runs the complete verification: clean, install, type-check, build, and list contents.

## Expected Result

After following these steps, you should see:

1. **Successful build** with no dependency errors
2. **dist/ folder created** with all production files
3. **All shadcn/ui components working** properly
4. **Name displayed as "Ian Betts"** throughout the site
5. **Email updated to "ian@ianbetts.design"** in contact section

## Troubleshooting

If you still get errors:

1. **Check Node version**: Should be 18+ for best compatibility
2. **Clear all caches**: 
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules/.cache
   rm -rf .cache
   npm run clean
   ```
3. **Manual file check**: Ensure `/public/_redirects` is a single text file, not a directory

## Quick Verification Commands

```bash
# Check if _redirects is a file (not directory)
file public/_redirects

# Should output: "public/_redirects: ASCII text"
# NOT: "public/_redirects: directory"

# Verify build works
npm run build && ls -la dist/
```

Your portfolio is now properly configured for Ian Betts with all build issues resolved!
