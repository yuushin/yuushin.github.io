# DEFINITIVE BUILD FIX for Ian Betts Portfolio

## The Problem
Your build is failing because:
1. **Wrong _redirects structure**: You have `/public/_redirects/` as a directory with TypeScript files
2. **Missing dependencies**: The @radix-ui packages aren't properly installed
3. **Version conflicts**: Some dependency versions are causing import resolution issues

## The Solution (Follow EXACTLY)

### Step 1: Fix Directory Structure Manually

**In your terminal, run these commands exactly:**

```bash
# Remove the problematic directory completely
rm -rf public/_redirects

# Create the correct structure  
mkdir -p public
echo "/*    /index.html   200" > public/_redirects

# Verify it's correct (should show a single file, not a directory)
ls -la public/
cat public/_redirects
```

**Expected output:**
```
-rw-r--r--  1 user  staff  23 Aug  5 12:00 _redirects
/*    /index.html   200
```

### Step 2: Clean Install Dependencies

```bash
# Remove all existing dependencies
rm -rf node_modules
rm -f package-lock.json

# Install fresh
npm install
```

### Step 3: Verify and Build

```bash
# Check for TypeScript errors first
npm run type-check

# If no errors, build
npm run build

# Verify dist folder was created
ls -la dist/
```

## If Still Getting Errors

### Alternative: Use the fix script
Make the fix script executable and run it:

```bash
chmod +x fix-build.sh
./fix-build.sh
```

### Manual verification commands:
```bash
# Check _redirects is a FILE not a directory
file public/_redirects
# Should output: "public/_redirects: ASCII text"

# Check if dependencies installed correctly  
npm list @radix-ui/react-slot
# Should show the version without errors

# Build with verbose output
npm run build -- --mode development
```

## Success Indicators

âœ… **You'll know it worked when:**
1. `npm run type-check` passes without errors
2. `npm run build` completes successfully  
3. A `dist/` folder is created with your built files
4. `public/_redirects` is a single text file (not a directory)

## Still Having Issues?

Check your file structure matches this exactly:
```
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ _redirects          <- Single file, NOT a directory
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ui/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ button.tsx      <- Should import @radix-ui/react-slot successfully
â””â”€â”€ package.json            <- Updated with exact dependency versions
```

The build should now work perfectly! ðŸŽ‰
